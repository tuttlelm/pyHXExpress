# [pyHXExpress](https://github.com/tuttlelm/pyHXExpress)

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks used to create the plots in the pyHXExpress paper.

GluFib data is located in the 'Bimodal_HDX_Data' folder (along with the other peptide datasets).

This folder also contains all outputs from the fixed 1-population and fixed 2-population fits of the HSPB5 WT, D109H, and R120G data. These outputs were used for the analysis in the HSPB5_disease_example.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
